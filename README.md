# A User's Manual for the Human Body
## A guide on how to operate this thing.

Here's the point. Let's say if someone was to throw you into a car and put you on to a different planet, and you can not get out of the car as long as you are there. It is this car that is keeping you alive there and you explore that world through this vehicle, what is the first most important thing that you need to do?

While it is good to know about the terrain and the geography of the place, the elements that are there and their orbital configuration, the biology of things and the history of the place, but what is the first priority?

It is to know how to operate the vehicle you are in. 

A person who doesn't know how to drive, him reaching anywhere would be accidental. However, a skilled driver can go anywhere, be it the highest mountains or the beaches or through the jungle . It is of the utmost importance to learn how to drive if you are in a car. You might not need to know all the engineering of it but having the functional knowledge of operation is critical. Thinking I'll learn it as I go and hitting the road isnt the best way to go about it.

We are born in the world into this Human Body. It is one of the most extraordinary and complicated machines that we know of. It is through this vehicle that we explore this world. and yet from the moment we are born, the world gets busy teaching us about everything that's outside, the history, technology, biology, geography, social science. But no one is teaching how to operate this body, this vehicle we are in, this car we are supposed to drive.

One of the reasons is, there's no User-Manual for this thing. No guide available, no operator's manual. Make no mistake, the information is all there, some of it in psychology, in biology, in neural networks, in computer science, in philosophy, in theology, bits and pieces of it, scattered everywhere. And then each and everyone of us have their own experiences too, a piece we have all figured out by ourselves in how to do something.  What isn't there is a compilation of everything humanity knows about operating the human body.
